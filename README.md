THERE ARE STILL THINGS TO BE FIXED:

1. make some frontend data js api instead of razor pages 
2. controllers must not contain buisness logic (especially this much), it has to be moved to service classes
3. put css into css files, js into js
4. fix musical player and put it in layout
5. change database achitecture, eg. likes and friends and subs must become many-to-many relationships
6. fix string concatenations
7. throwing an exception when entering some user's profile while unauthenticated

THERE ARE STILL STINGS TO BE ADDED:
1. groups
2. group roles
3. search (music, people, groups)
4. photo likes and comments quantity when hover
5. better buttons
6. buttons to accept/deny friend requests instantly
7. personal information
8. comment replies 


+ other minor bug fixes, code reformat, etc.
